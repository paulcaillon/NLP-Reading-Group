This page is dedicated to the NLP reading group at Loria organized by the [SyNaLP Team](https://synalp.loria.fr). 

This reading group is the designated successor of the previous ones organized by Timothee Mickus ([here](https://timotheemickus.github.io/reading_group.html)) and [Hoa Le](https://lethienhoablog.wordpress.com) ([here](https://github.com/lethienhoa/Deep-Learning-and-Natural-Language-Understanding-Reading-Group)).

This group aims in particular to be a space for discussion between all the NLP-interested teams and labs across Nancy (Synalp, Multispeech, Atilf, ...). 

In this way, you are all very welcome to contact me to present a paper (paul.caillon_at_loria_dot_fr).
